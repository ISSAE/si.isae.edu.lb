# These are suggested Rewrite Rules for use with Tiki.
# They enhance security and permit short URLs.
# In your Tiki instance, visit admin.php?page=sefurl
#
# To use
# 1- rename _htaccess to .htaccess
# or
# 2- add the content of this file to your httpd.conf
#
# Please find more info here
# http://doc.tiki.org/Rewrite+Rules
#
# This prevents reading of files with certain extensions.

# Error pages, handled by Apache (not by Tiki)
# Tiki can catch some errors and deal with them by redirecting to a similar page, sending you to the search, etc. However, some errors bypass Tiki and must be handled by Apache (ex.: impossiblepagename.php) 
# To use Apache error handling, uncomment the following line and adapt the page name. You must create the page before trying to use it. 
# ErrorDocument 404 /index.php?page=Page+not+found

# to activate the error display, uncomment the following line
#php_flag display_errors on

# increase memory
#php_value memory_limit 128M

# increase execution time (default value in apache use to be 30, and in some cases of long wiki pages with many plugins it may take longer)
#php_value max_execution_time 90

# increase the maximum file size for uploads allowed by php for Tiki (default value in apache use to be 2M which is usually too low for pdf or documents with some images, screenshots, etc)
#php_value upload_max_filesize 10M

# In some cases you may see open_basedir warnings about Smarty accessing php files that it shouldn't
# The following line (uncommented) will reset the include path to use only Tiki's files which will solve this in most cases
#php_value include_path "."
